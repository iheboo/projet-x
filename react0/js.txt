Commands used:
cd: Changes which directory your terminal is looking at.
cat: Outputs the contents of a text file into the terminal window.


Basic Commands for Mac, Linux, Cmder
To get started, open up your terminal and try the commands below. Note that most of these work well in the Windows command prompt (cmd) as well, and where the commands differ, they are noted. 

Present working directory

pwd
copy
Use this command any time you are unsure where you are currently in your file structure. pwd stands for Present Working Directory. For Windows, you may either use pwd or cd.

List files

ls
copy
Use the ls command to see all the directories and files that are in your current directory. To clear things up, a directory is just a synonym for a folder. In 'cmd', use the dir command instead. 

List files (long form)

ls -l
copy
Use the 'ls -l' command to see a long form, representation of the directories and files inside your current directory.

You will see some cryptic messages on the side. The 'drwx' thing that you see are just file permissions for that particular directory or file. For example, the first set of '-'s that follow the 'd' are the permissions allowed for the user. If it says 'rwx' it means the user is allowed to read, write and execute the file. If it just says 'r--' means that the user can only read the file. The second set of three '-'s represent the permissions for a group. The last three '-'s represent the permissions for people who are not the user and are not in the particular group that is allowed. We will have to be changing some of these permissions when we deploy our applications in the cloud. For now, it's important to know that there are different file permissions which can either be read, write, or execute, and these permissions can vary depending on if you are the user, or in the group specified in the listing.

List all files (long form)

ls -a
copy
Use the 'ls - a' command to see ALL the files. Linux flavored operating systems hide files that start with a '.' by default. This command will show all the previous files and hidden files if there are any. The files that start with a '.' are often configuration files.

Changing to the current directory

cd .
copy
From the previous command, we saw that 'ls - a' will list some interesting file names like '.' and '..' The '.' is reserved to represent the current directory that we are in. If you run the 'cd . ' and then run the 'pwd' command, you'll see that we didn't move to a different directory. We told the computer to change our directory to our current directory which means don't go anywhere! The cd command works well in 'cmd' as well. 

Changing to the parent directory

cd ..
copy
Like the 'cd . ' command, the '..' is reserved to represent the parent directory of the current folder that we are in. If you run this command and then run the 'pwd' command, you'll see that we navigated up one directory(folder) structure. If you feel like the File Structure is starting to resemble the DOM (Document Object Model), it's because they are very similar.

Changing to the root directory

cd /
copy
This command will change to the root directory of your computer. From this folder, you can access your application folders.

Changing to any folder

cd folder_name
copy
The 'cd' command followed by a space and name of the folder you want to access will move you into that directory, if it exists. This example would move you into the 'folder_name' directory.

Making a new folder

mkdir new_directory_name
copy
This command will make a new directory named 'new_directory_name'. Whatever argument you pass into this command will be the name of your new file. After making the directory, you could run 'cd new_folder_name' to enter into that directory.

Delete an empty directory(folder)

rm directory_name
//or
rmdir directory_namecopy
Delete a non-empty directory(folder)

rm -rf directory_name
copy
If you try to delete a folder with contents inside you will get an error! Our computer wants us to say more explicitly to delete this directory and everything inside of it by passing the '-rf' option. Be careful with this command as could it accidentally delete files you didn't intend to delete or delete some config files that you wouldn't want deleted at all! In 'cmd', the command name is del, but the results are the same. 

Creating a new file

touch index.html
touch style.css
copy
The 'touch' command will create a new, empty file with the name and extension type that you specify. You can make any type of file if you provide the extension type. Run the above commands, and then run 'ls' and you will see your new files in the listing.

Removing a file

rm index.html
copy
The 'rm' command removes any file with the filename and extension provided.

Renaming/Moving a file

mv index.html new_name_index.html
mv new_name_index.html ../new_name_index.html
copy
The 'mv' command has two uses. First, you can rename a file by first providing the file's name and then providing what you want the file to be renamed to. In the first example, index.html would be renamed to new_name_index.html. Second, it can be used to move a file to a different folder. In the second example, new_name_index.html would be moved up one directory with the same name. In either case, think of this command as moving a file - into its current directory with a different name or into a different directory with the same or different name.

Copying a file

cp index.html copy.html
copy
The 'cp' command will copy a file into the current directory with the new name you provided. In the example, say you were in your Desktop directory and you ran the above command. The Desktop directory would now have index.html and copy.html in it.

Copying a directory

cp -rf directory_name copy_directory_name
copy
Copying a directory is similar to a file but we need to pass the '-rf' option in order to copy all the internal contents of the directory. First provide the name of the directory you want to copy and then the name of the copy.

Opening current directory in your GUI

open .
copy
The 'open' command will open your current directory in your GUI (in 'cmd' or command prompt, use "start ." instead). Likewise, you could open a file inside your directory by running something like "open file_name". *Note* this command will only work on your local machine, but not on your virtual machine in the Cloud when you are deploying.

Last note

When you are navigating the terminal on your virtual machine in the Cloud, you may encounter these commands throwing back an error. When that happens, prefix your command with 'sudo' which tells the computer that you are the Super User. 'sudo' stands for 'Super User do'. This will become more relevant when we start deploying applications in the cloud, but just know that something like 'sudo' exists.

//for example, you can run all the same commands but prefix them with sudo
sudo mkdir test
sudo touch index.html
sudo rm -rf test


***********************************************************
jQuery
jQuery is a library that specializes in making the JavaScript code we write easier and more concise. As it's a library we will need to add the code into our project as a script tag. We can either download the code or use a CDN (content delivery network) link to use the library hosted on another server. jQuery has been in use for a number of years and looking for how to achieve some front-end effect online often yields results using jQuery. jQuery is also sometimes a dependency for other libraries we might want to use. As such it's a good library to learn the basics about.

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js"></script>copy
As this code will provide functionality we will want to ensure this script is in our code before the script tag containing our code.

Adding Event Listeners
One thing we can do in JavaScript is what's known as attaching event listeners to our code. Below is an example that adds an alert message whenever any buttons on our site are clicked.

var btns = document.querySelectorAll("button");
    
for(var i=0; i<btns.length; i++) {
    btns[i].addEventListener("click", function(){
        alert("Button clicked!");
    });
}copy
This is equivalent to adding an onclick="alert('Button clicked')" to each button tag on the page. This takes a few lines to do using normal JavaScript. In jQuery we can instead write code that looks like the following.

$("button").click(function() {
    alert("Button clicked");
});copy
In jQuery the library exposes the variable $ to us which we can call as a function by passing in the selector we want to use. Then we have many options for what to do next. In this case we attached an event listener for a "click" event. We also have to provide some function to call when the click event happens.

Other Events
Some other events we can listen to using jQuery are

.hover	A method that allows us to conveniently define what should happen on mouse enter and on mouse leave
.change	A method to listen the changes on form inputs and selects
.submit	A method to listen to the a form being submitted
Effects
jQuery also has many effects we can also call on to add new elements, modify elements, and remove elements. Some of them have animation effects added in as well. The .hide effect will hide an element whereas .fadeOut will remove the element in a slow fading out effect and .slideUp will have the element collapse upward by shrinking the element height until it dissapears.

.show

.hide

.toggle	Methods to hide or show an element.
.toggle combines the two into one method.
.fadeOut

.fadeIn

.fadeToggle	Methods that animate hiding and showing with a fade effect
.slideUp

.slideDown

.slideToggle	Methods that animate hiding and showing with a sliding effect
DOM Manipulation
jQuery also makes writing DOM manipulation code a breeze.

.attr	Method to get or set an element's attribute
.text	Method to get or set the text inside an element
.html	Method to alter the HTML inside of an element
.append

.prepend	Methods to add new elements at the end of beginning of an element
Styles can also be easily modified using jQuery methods.

.css	Method to alter an element's CSS properties
.addClass

.removeClass	Methods to add and remove CSS classes on an element.
